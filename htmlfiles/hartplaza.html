        <p>My HomeTown is Detroit, Michigan which is located in the MidWest United States of America. The city is located on a border crossing with Canada and Detroit is considered the Motor City due to its history with the automotive industry. Detroit is the birthplace of the assembly line and is on the rise from the RustBelt slump. Due to the low cost of living it has become a cultural capitol and always has encouraged its artists and dreamers. This photo was taken on a summer day in Hart Plaza which is the gathering space located on the riverfront where many of the festivals are held. Detroit city has a diverse and interesting background and I encourage you all to visit the city whose motto Speramus Meliora; Resurget Cineribus means "We hope for Better Things It shall Rise from the Ashes," and that has become very true of the city
